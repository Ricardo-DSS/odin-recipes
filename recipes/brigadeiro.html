        <h2>Did you already try this delicious recipe?</h2>

        <p>Brigadeiro is the most popular sweet in Brazil, it started in 1945 with a political campaign….. Let me tell you how it began!</p>
        <p>In 1945, shortly after World War II , Brazil was having an electoral campaign for a new President. The candidate was Eduardo Gomes, whose military rank was Brigadeiro. He was very popular amongst women for being good looking and single, so the campaign slogan was “ Vote for Brigadeiro, he is handsome and single”.</p>
        <p>To promote his campaign, parties were organised to raise funds and to give more visibility to the candidate. In these parties they decided to prepare a sweet to be sold to the public, and this sweet was "The Brigadeiro".</p>
        <p>At the time, milk and sugar were hard to find, so they decided to use condensed milk, chocolate and butter to make the chocolate. ”Brigadeiro” was born.</p>

        <p>Let's take a look the list below</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
